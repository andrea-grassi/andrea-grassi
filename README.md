# 👋 Hi, I’m @andrea-grassi

- 👀 I’m interested in electronics, computer science, 3D printing, robotics, and DIY projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in electronics engineering and software development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that combine electronics and software, especially in the fields of automation and manufacturing.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through GitHub or via email at [(https://t.me/sbrasbrez)].
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m currently building a CNC Milling/Laser machine from scratch! I’m always on the lookout for new experiences and projects to dive into.

When I’m not immersed in my studies or building something new, I love traveling and exploring different cultures and traditions. Each trip is an opportunity to discover new ways of thinking and living, which inspires my projects and ideas.
